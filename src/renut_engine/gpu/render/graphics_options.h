 * @brief   Graphics quality beyond the console's (Nuts&Bolts/Graphics):
 *          shadow map and ambient occlusion resolution, anisotropic
 *          filtering.
 *
 * - renut_shadow_resolution: the shadow maps' render scale. The sun's two
 *   cascades are 1024x1024 and 768x768 D24S8 targets (512x512 in split
 *   screen; sub_822998C8), and the local lights render 512x512 D24S8 depth
 *   converted in a 512x512 16_16_FLOAT target into a 2048x2048 atlas
 *   (sub_823B3CE0); by default they follow the render resolution.
 * - renut_ambient_occlusion: the SSAO pass (sub_8235FA90) renders at half
 *   the screen, into 640x360 targets at EDRAM base 1864; Full renders it at
 *   the screen's resolution.
 * - renut_anisotropic_filtering: the least a texture's linear minification
 *   filters anisotropically.
 * - renut_post_process_precision: the 8_8_8_8 targets of half the screen or
 *   less (bloom, depth of field, SSAO) as 16-bit unorm on the host. The bloom
 *   (bright pass at 640x360 from the 8-bit scene, then 320x180 down to 80x45,
 *   added at weights 1, 1.2, 1.6 and 2) carries a faint glow in 1/255 steps;
 *   upscaled to the screen they show as blobs that slide over dark areas as
 *   the camera moves. A resolve's destination takes its source's host format,
 *   so the passes reading them see the finer values too.
 * - renut_depth_of_field: the fog object's full-screen composite
 *   (sub_82217628; VS 950f5ca8b083fa7c, PS a5e26fb9039da3bf in the main
 *   game) blends the sharp scene toward the blurred one by
 *   min(saturate(distance outside the focus range * c192.x near / c192.y
 *   far), c194.w), c194.w being the most blur (0.8). Reduced halves the
 *   scales and the cap in that draw's constants, Off zeroes them.
